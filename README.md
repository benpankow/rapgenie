Rapgenie is a Python wrapper that grants easy access to lyrics and metadata from <a href="https://genius.com">genius.com</a>, a large repository of music lyrics and user annotations. Rapgenie allows the user to easily access and data fetched from the official <a href="https://docs.genius.com/">genius.com API</a> including annotations and song metadata, in addition to scraped genius.com lyrics.<br><br>
For lyrical analysis purposes, rapgenie will separate out intros, hooks, verses, and other segments of desired songs. On songs with featured artists, rapgenie will distinguish which lyrics are delivered by which artist, and can even handle 'swapping bars' in the middle of verses.<br><br>
Rapgenie is not yet finished, but is in current development.
