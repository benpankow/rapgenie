Rapgenie is a Python wrapper that grants easy access to lyrics and metadata from <a href="https://genius.com">genius.com</a>, a large repository of music lyrics and user annotations. Rapgenie allows access to both scraped genius.com lyrics and data fetched from the official <a href="https://docs.genius.com/">genius.com API</a> including annotations and song metadata.<br><br>
For lyric analysis purposes, rapgenie will separate out intros, hooks, verses, and other song segments. On songs with featured artists, rapgenie will distinguish which lyrics are delivered by which artist, and can even handle 'swapping bars' in the middle of verses.<br><br>
Rapgenie is not yet finished, but is in current development.
